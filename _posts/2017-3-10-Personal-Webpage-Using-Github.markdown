Recently I started using Github due to the convenience of distributing lab materials of a stats class. **Blackboard is a nightmare!**
The nice control version function of Github is a great plus for researchers. Besides, as I'm using markdown, it is very intuitive to me to adpat to 
the writing rules here. 

Creating a webpage on Github is not that 'user-friendly' as it requires some knowledge of coding. Fortunately there're plenty of templates online and 
all you need to do is to customize that. My webpage is created with the template of [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme). I spent about 
4 hours learning it, so far it works pretty well! Particularly I like the function that I can write in a markdown file and git it while done. 
If you like markdown, THIS IS THE PLACE!
