Recently I started using Github due for the convenience of distributing lab materials of a stats class.
The nice control version of Github is a great plus for researchers. Besides, as I'm using markdown, it is very intuitive to me to adpat to 
the writing rules here. 

Creating a webpage on Github is not that 'user-friendly' as it requires some knowledge of coding. Fortunately there're plenty of templates online and 
all you need to do is to custemize that. My webpage is created with the template of [Long Haul](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul). I spent about 
3 hours learning it, so far it works pretty well!
