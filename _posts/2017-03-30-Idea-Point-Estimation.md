In today's machine learning class we talk about the bags of words and sentiment analysis.
This seems so interesting and I feel a supervised learning model on senators' twitter followers data could be used as a novel way of ideal point estimate. 

Some [relevant stuffs]:(http://www.gsood.com/research/papers/mediabias.pdf). And [this](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/papers/KDD14_Voting_Oct.pdf).

BTW, I really like [Gaurav Sood](http://www.gsood.com/)'s study, his topics are so interesting. After reading a whole semester's institutions, I felt I'm exhausted about political science, now I'm glad it is not because I lost interest, but some stuffs just don't interest me.
