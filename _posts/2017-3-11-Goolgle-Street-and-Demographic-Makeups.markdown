Recently I read a brilliant article. [CLIKE HERE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06683).

Gebru et al. (2017) apply deeping learning method with google streets. The core idea is to identify the car models in the google street images.

As car models have a strong connection with family makeup (e.g. A families with 2 kids are much more likely to own a MPV), they use this technique
to predict the demographic composition in certain districts. In a comparison between the 'predicted' makeup and actual makeup in Wisconsin, they found
it's actually quite accurate.


Apparently Ford trucks are strong related to Republican supporters!
