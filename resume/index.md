With five years experience in social science, I immersed myself with highly skilled quantative methods: econometrics, time-series analysis, mixed models, survival models, categorical data analysis etc.

Besides, I developed a strong interest in machine learning and text mining while working at the U.S. Presidents' State of the Union Address. 

Grad school taught me how to stay as an active learner and how to express myself with the aid of data and graphs (check my [teaching folder](https://github.com/haowang666/POS603-Lab) for R).
